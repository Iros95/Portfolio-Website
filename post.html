            <h2>How I Created This Website</h2>
            <img id="main-post-pick" src="images/html-css-javascript.jpg">
            <p> The first post will be rather short. My goal was to create 
            a very simplistic website that serves as a portfolio for my programming projects.
            </p>
            <p>I am not a veteran in terms of making front-end stuff. 
            I definitely see myself more as a back-end developer, but in my opinion, 
            it's important to have at least a basic understanding of web development 
            and know how to create a simple website like this.</p>
            <p>I've worked with HTML and CSS before, but mostly as a side tool for projects that were mostly focused on other technologies. Furthermore,
            I want to improve my web development skills and, in the future, create more complex projects.</p>
            <h4>Used Technologies</h3>
            <p>This website was created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            As I said in the first paragraph, I wanted this website to have a very minimalistic design
            and to aim my focus on the basics while creating it.</p>
            <p>I won't show the full process of development, because it was rather short, but in the last section of this post I will link to the source code. 
            If you are interested in the details of the implementation, make sure to check it out.</p>
            <h4>My Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The best resources that helped me in the creation process were the tutorials from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia">Traversy Media YouTube channel</a>. 
            They have a lot of videos where more advanced programmers explain concepts and show how to create your own projects. 
            The most helpful guide for me was the one made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZRcDjjkVajGL6wd76UnGg">Denis Ivy</a>, and I definitely recommend checking out more of his work.</p>
            <p>Other than that, I used the knowledge that I already had, and when I didn't know how to do something, I did what every programmer does, which is search the net for an answer,
             and find it on Stack Overflow or other forums.</p>
            <h4>Code</h3>
            <p>This project's complete source code is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZRcDjjkVajGL6wd76UnGg">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
